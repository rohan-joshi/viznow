MHacks IV @ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor from September 5-7, 2014!

A data-visalization tool that allows users to upload a data file in one of many formats like .csv, .tsv, .json or .xls and displays the appropriate line graph, chord diagram, chloropleth visualization or interactive bubble graph.

Also connects to the Bloomberg API to fetch real-time information from the Bloomberg servers about certain tech tickers to then display the appropriate data in interactive line graphs.
